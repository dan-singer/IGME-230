## The Process
I began by creating a mockup of what I wanted the Checkers app to look like with Inkscape. 
After that, I started planning out what objects I wanted to create, and what properties and 
functions they should have. After planning, I laid out the basic html, styled it appropriately,
and added behaviour with JavaScript.

## Special
- Be sure to try this on other devices, it's mobile friendly! (Note that resizing the window requires a page reload, however)
- The core logic is in checkers.js
    - You cannot move a checker to an invalid cell, and jumps are accounted for.
    - This is done by utilizing a graph, implemented with the checkersMap Map.
- The players checkers are stored in a Set, allowing quick removal and checking 

## Meeting the requirements
This application is fun, runs without any errors, is visually appealing on all devices,
uses proper HTML and CSS, contains well-documented JavaScript code, and is a polished,
professional web application.
