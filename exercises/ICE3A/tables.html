            <p>My academic interests range from game development to music. I've always enjoyed playing video games, which is how I got 
                into programming, and eventually game development.

                Regarding music, I first began playing the saxophone about 10 years ago, and haven't stopped since. 
                As such, I'm really interested in Jazz, as well as music composition.

            <p>
                On the side, I also enjoy swing dancing, and, of course, hanging out with friends.
