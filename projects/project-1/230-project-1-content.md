### Mechanics
- The player can fight each of the GL5s in any order, with the exception of the final one, which must be fought after beating the others. 
- They can pilot their ship and fly in any direction. The camera will follow the ship everywhere, so it will be one large "room" rather 
than several smaller ones.
- There will be 4 GL5s to destroy, and each will give the player an additional unit of health.
- Health and score pickups will be availble throughout the world.

### Controls
- Keyboard controls only.
- Navigate ship: Arrows or WASD
- Fire projectile: Space
- Pause: Escape or Backspace

### Player Learning
Before the game starts, a message will be displayed stating: "Arrows/WASD = Move. Space = Fire." No other control instructions will be given, as 
the core mechanics are pretty simple.

## Other
- Music will be original and created with FL Studio.
- This game will be developed with [pixi.js](http://www.pixijs.com/)
