## Story
**Narrative/Premise:** Evil aliens known as GL5s have been ravaging the space system.
You captain a space ship in the year 3000 and are tasked with finding and destroying each of these GL5 creatures. 
There are four of them to discover in this isolated world, and the fifth, more dangerous one will appear after
defeating the four main GL5 creatures.

## Gameplay
![Gameplay](mockup-2.png "Gameplay")
### Mechanics
- The player can fight each of the GL5s in any order, with the exception of the final one, which must be fought after defeating the others. 
- The player can pilot their ship and fly in any direction. The camera will follow the ship everywhere, so it will be one large "room" rather 
than several smaller ones.
- There will be 4 GL5s to destroy, and each will raise the players's maximum health by one unit.
- Health and score pickups will be availble throughout the world.

### Controls
- Keyboard controls only.
- Navigate ship: Arrows or WASD
- Fire projectile: Space or Left Click
- Pause: Escape or Backspace

### Player Learning
Before the game starts, a message will be displayed stating, "Arrows/WASD = Move. Space = Fire." No other control instructions will be given, as 
the core mechanics are fairly simple, and the lack of instructions will generate a sense of isolation.

## Other
- Music will be original and created with FL Studio.
- This game will be developed with [pixi.js](http://www.pixijs.com/)
