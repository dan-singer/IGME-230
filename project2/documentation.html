                <h2>The Process</h2>
                <p>I began by creating a mockup of what I wanted the Checkers app to look like with Inkscape. 
                        After that, I started planning out what objects I wanted to create, and what properties and 
                        functions they should have. After planning, I laid out the basic html, styled it appropriately,
                        and added behaviour with JavaScript.

                    <li>Be sure to try this on other devices, it's mobile friendly! (Note that resizing the window requires a page reload, however)</li>
                    <li>The core logic is in checkers.js, and the player object is defined in checkerDataTypes.js</li>
                    <li>You cannot move a checker to an invalid cell, and jumps are accounted for. This is done by utlizing a graph, implemented with the checkerMap Map object</li>
                    <li>The players' checkers are stored in a Set, allowing for quick removal and lookup.</li>
